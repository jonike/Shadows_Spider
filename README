The controls are Alt-LMB / RMB camera navigation with shift, ctrl, and space modifiers.

Dragging manipulators and changing the values of attribute editor cells is done with MMB with ctrl or shift modifiers to slow down or speed up the value change.

Every QComboBox is a radial menu opened by holding RMB over it.
