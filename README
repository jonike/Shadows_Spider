The controls are similar to other DCC applications, with an alt-LMB / RMB camera navigation with shift, ctrl, and space modifiers.

Dragging manipulators and changing the values of attribute editor cells is done with MMB with ctrl or shift modifiers to slow down or speed up the value change.

Every QComboBox is a radial menu opened by holding RMB over it.

The obj files that can be used have to be very simple at this point since the loader needs work.

DDS reflection cubemaps need to be 16f, 16f, 16f, 16f, convolved to take a roughness parameter, with GGX. The irradiance map needs to also be present for IBL workflow.
